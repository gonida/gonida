### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m Gonida, IT Professional with a passion for producing quite an impact with my work.
- 👀 I have more than 10 years of experience under my belt - the one that leaves burning buildings and a sense of satisfaction for my customers.
- 🌱 I come with best of both worlds of Blockchain and Web, Big Data - you tell me which side is the worst. I could do a project if it involves Java, Spring, Hibernate, Node.js, EVM chain, solana chain, Wax chain, React, Vue, Svelte, Angular and that whole story with possibly Kotlin and Python involved. But on the other hand - I could help you build a Data Warehouse and connect data streams with ETL to it using Hadoop with Spark stack and Scala programming language.
- 💞️ I also am proficient in clouds
- 📫 If your business or your team or your project is in serious need of creating some quality systems or products, get in touch now! 


Feel free to reach me.
